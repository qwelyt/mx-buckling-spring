# mx-buckling-spring
3D-printable buckling spring switch with an MX-switch footprint.


Create a buckling spring switch that fits in the same footprint as a MX-switch. The goal is to be able to print a bunch of these and have buckling spring switches in any keyboard you can have MX switches in. These are not capacitive switches like the IBM ones. They rely one some sort of contact leaf.

Basically, the entire goal is to be able to put them in any mechanical keyboard you already have lying around.
